For each segmentation point in a particular word (given by its xcoordinate),
a matrix of pixels is extracted and stored in an
A‚Äù training file. Each matrix is first normalised in size,
and then significantly reduced in size by a simple feature
extractor. The feature extractor breaks the segmentation
point matrix down into small windows of equal size and
analyses the density of black and white pixels. Therefore,
instead of presenting the raw pixel values of the
segmentation points to the ANN, only the densities of each
window are presented.
