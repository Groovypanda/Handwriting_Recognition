?	Inserts exactly one word. 
*	Inserts zero or more words.
/	To be read as an "or", which checks for the presence of the left- and right-hand side word. This operator can be chained.	
+	Completes a word prefix. At least the first three letters must be given.
"â€¦"	Groups several words together that should be treated as a phrase. This operator is only useful in conjunction with the / operator.

'''
Calculate the probabilities of every word given the n previous words in the sentence.
Example usage 
n_gram_model('The bridesman loves the', ['girl', 'man', 'sheep'], n=2) 
Returns: [('man', 0.56), ('girl', 0.39), ('sheep', 0.05)]
Punctuation needs spaces.
