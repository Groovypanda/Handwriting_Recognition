?	Inserts exactly one word. 
*	Inserts zero or more words.
/	To be read as an "or", which checks for the presence of the left- and right-hand side word. This operator can be chained.	
+	Completes a word prefix. At least the first three letters must be given.
"â€¦"	Groups several words together that should be treated as a phrase. This operator is only useful in conjunction with the / operator.
